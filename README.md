# Weather Scraper

This Python script scrapes the current temperature in New York City from the National Weather Service website and displays it in both Fahrenheit and Celsius. It runs continuously, retrieving updated temperature data every minute.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `beautifulsoup4` library

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Run the script `weather_scraper.py` using Python:

   ```bash
   python weather_scraper.py
   ```

3. The script will continuously print the current temperature in New York City in both Fahrenheit and Celsius. It will update every minute.

## Customization

- You can modify the latitude and longitude in the URL variable `url` to retrieve weather data for a different location.
- Adjust the sleep time in the script (`time.sleep(60)`) to change how frequently the script retrieves and displays updated weather information.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with running the script, ensure that you have installed the required libraries and that your internet connection is stable.
- If you receive errors related to the website structure changing, you may need to update the script to match the new HTML structure of the National Weather Service website.
